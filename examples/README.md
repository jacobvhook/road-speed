# Examples

This folder contains notebooks that we used to analyze data, build our models
and to test the custom classes that can be found in `../src`.

- `speed_humps.ipynb` contains our data analysis on the impact of speed humps on
  NYC collision rates.
- `regression_traffic_vol.ipynb` is the notebook used to build our regression
  models.
- `test.ipynb` runs our models against the test dataset. To run this notebook,
  you must first build the models with `regression_traffic_vol.ipynb`.
- The other notebooks were used to test our custom classes.
